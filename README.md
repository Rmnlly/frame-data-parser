# Frame Data Parser

Frame Data Parser is a nodejs application that is meant to take a community created document on Super Smash Bros Ultimate the game and make the data within those docs usable for web applications.

The program takes the data from following goolge sheet using googles api, gets the character names from the sheets, transforms the data and saves each characters move data into its own json file.

[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Patch 9.0/10.0/10.1 sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16fmsoqDoQaR1eteVk2uuzIH2DB4iQHVrqiG8VRbRA7Q/edit)

Notes on how to update sheet data to latest patch:

- To update the sheet search for "Smash Bros. Ultimate Patch X.X goolge sheet", first article is likely it
- Open it, make a copy to your personal google drive
- Note the spreadsheetid is in the url after the `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/`
- Replace the ID being used in the `sheet-char-names.js` and `sheet-char-data` files


### Installation

Clone this repo

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd frame-data-parser
$ npm install
```

Now in the following files you would need to change to the `spreadsheetId` to a copy you make of the sheet I have attached above

- `sheet-char-data.js`
- `sheet-char-names.js`

## Starting the app

```sh
$ npm run start

you will then be prompted to follow a link
and authenticate with your google account
```
